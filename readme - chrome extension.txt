This extension is a maintained fork of the original Chrome extension by Daniele Mazzini (danmaz74). The original project introduced the idea and implementation, and this fork keeps that behavior up to date for current Hacker News pages and Manifest v3.

This extension helps you save time on Hacker News with the following features:

1) Mark Stories as Read - Mark all entries as read and gray them out.

2) Mark Comments as Read - Same as mark stories, but for comments.

3) Hide Read Comments - See only new comments after your last read mark.

4) Follow Comments - Track comment count changes for selected stories.

5) Show Parent Comment - Hover to preview the parent comment for context.

6) Collapse / Expand All Comments - Collapse long threads and expand when needed.

Enjoy!
